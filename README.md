This is the repo for my personal website [(igalaxy.dev)](https://igalaxy.dev), built using Next.js and hosted on Vercel.

## Pages

The website currently includes two pages:
- [igalaxy.dev/](https://igalaxy.dev) - Home
- [igalaxy.dev/tab](https://igalaxy.dev/tab) - New Tab

The New Tab page is heavily inspired by [Tabatha](https://github.com/dustinrouillard/tabatha). \
It can be customized for your own use through query parameters or LocalStorage. Query parameters take priority.
- `discordId` - Discord user ID for the status card. The user must be in the [Lanyard](https://github.com/Phineas/Lanyard) Discord server.
- `name` - The name to be shown for the greeting.

## Development

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
